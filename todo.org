# To do
- Operators :: Finish implementing
- Blog :: Write post about history of dimensioned
- Doc :: Rewrite docs as well as website tutorials
- Examples :: Monte Carlo w/ and w/out units, currency converter app
- Readme :: Write extensive readme

- Index/IndexMut :: Lifetime stuff that I need to figure out
- Impls :: Include impls for references and not just pass-by-value?
- convert value using from
- add mul_units, etc functions to make interfaces better
- test all ops extensively if possible
- restructure ops in macro

# Questions
- What all derived types should be generated? Do with build script or just macro?
- What unit systems to include? Definitely si and cgs. fps? An imperial si alternative? Does one
  exist?
- does unitless print right?=

# Future
- OIBIT :: Once opt-in built-in traits stabilizes, we can deprecate the feature and add it to beta
           / stable
- on_unimplemented :: Once this stabilizes, we can try to pretty up our error messages a bit

- Numerics :: If and when Rust supports numerics and arithmetic in type signatures, switch to using
              them instead of typenum. This is almost certainly in the far future.
