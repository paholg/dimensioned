# To do
- Blog :: Write post about history of dimensioned?
- Doc :: Rewrite docs as well as website tutorial
- Examples :: Monte Carlo w/ and w/out units
- Readme :: Write extensive readme

- Convert :: impl From
- test all ops extensively if possible
add constant block to mscro, finish unit systems

# Questions
- What all derived types should be generated? Do with build script or just macro?
- What unit systems to include? Definitely si and cgs. fps? An imperial si alternative? Does one
  exist?

# Future
- OIBIT :: Once opt-in built-in traits stabilizes, we can deprecate the feature and add it to beta
           / stable

- on_unimplemented :: Once this stabilizes, we can try try to make error messages better.

- Numerics :: If and when Rust supports numerics and arithmetic in type signatures, switch to using
              them instead of typenum. This is almost certainly in the far future.

- Serialize / Deserialize
