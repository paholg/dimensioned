# To do
- Operators :: Finish implementing
- Blog :: Write post about history of dimensioned
- Doc :: Rewrite docs as well as website tutorials
- Examples :: Monte Carlo w/ and w/out units, currency converter app.

- Index/IndexMut :: Lifetime stuff that I need to figure out.
- Impls :: Include impls for references and not just pass-by-value.


# Questions
- make_units! :: Allow custom print?

# Future
- Numerics :: If and when Rust supports numerics and arithmetic in type signatures,
              switch to using them. This will likely correspond to a version 2.0 of
              dimensioned.
